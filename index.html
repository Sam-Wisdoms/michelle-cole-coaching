        <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
        <p>
            On the journey of life, the experiences we go through can sometimes drive our passion for the things we do, so that we can be a source of encouragement and support for others 
            who go through similar things. There are times when certain things we go through may not not feel or seem as important memories to remember. However, it is also through that 
            certain experiences we go through in life cannot be forgotten. Over the years, global organizations such as the United Nations, World Health Organization, The World Bank and 
            Civil Societies have earmaked certain dates as dates for special celebrations or recognition. One such dates which will remain a memorable date in my life is World Prematurity 
            day which is marked on 17th November of each year. I am a mother of a healthy, thriving, six year old. Her entrance into the world however, wasn't quite what I had expected as it was 
            just quite too early for any kind of birth plan and we were weeks away from our NCT cource.
